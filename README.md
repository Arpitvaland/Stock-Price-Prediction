This project focuses on predicting stock prices using data scraping, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and trend analysis. Two linear models have been implemented for predictions.

## Project Structure

- 1. Scrapping Data:
  - Utilizes web scraping techniques to gather relevant data for stock price prediction.
  
- 2. EDA on Scrapped Data:
  - Conducts Exploratory Data Analysis on the scraped data to understand patterns, trends, and potential features for modeling.
  
- 3. Trend Analysis:
  - Investigates and analyzes trends within the stock market data to inform the modeling process.

- 4. Linear Models:
  -  models for stock price predictions. 
  - Model 1: Regression model
